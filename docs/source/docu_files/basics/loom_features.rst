Why Loom?
===================

Recent developments in quantum computing have shown that quantum error correction (QEC) is a crucial component for building reliable quantum computers. Proposed designs of error correction schemes quickly becomes very complex when increasing the number of logical qubits. 

Loom provides tools to easily design quantum error correction codes with high-level abstraction, and then to convert it to low-level quantum circuits that can be executed on various backends. Finally, Loom additionally provides tools to analyze the performance of the quantum error correction codes. 

This allows researchers and developers to focus on the high-level design of quantum error correction codes and to quickly test and evaluate both the performance of the codes and the underlying hardware.
