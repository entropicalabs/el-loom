Eka Architecture
==========================

Loom provides a flexible and extensible framework for representing quantum circuits, quantum error correction schemes, and high-level quantum algorithms involving QEC. 
This section delves into the architecture of Loom, focusing on its core data representation known as :class:`~loom.eka.eka.Eka`.
